# Bookshelf/My Library  
### A Digital Bookshelf and Book Reviewer
My Library will allow the user to create Bookshelves, which are collections of Books. Books will be pulled in using data from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview). The user will also be able to review Books. A review contains a 1-5 star rating and a text review.
